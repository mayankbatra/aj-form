Let's start with a basic problem statement of an assessment platform. Let's create a basic assessment platform that can:
- Define different types of questions and tag them to different functional areas
- Load questions based on the choice of functional areas
- Have a provision of populating the widget based on the type of question
- Apply Javascript validations/features based on the type of widget
- Have server side validation submitted answer based on the widget
- Score based on the solution and the widget (can be very basic - correct/incorrect)
